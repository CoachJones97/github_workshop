# Merging changes and contributing to a project

As a reminder,
- **pull request:** change proposal to merge one branch into another
- **push:** moving changes from a local copy to a different copy
- **pull:** getting changes from a different copy to apply to a local copy

### Merging branches with pull requests

A **pull request** allows review and commenting before the actual merge.

First, navigate to the branch you made in the previous tutorial. Click on "Contribute" --> "Open pull request" to begin the process of merging two branches.

In the pull request form, make sure the `base` respository is your own. Add a descriptive title and informative description of the changes. Scroll down to see commits and changes to ensure these are what you want to merge. Then, click "Create pull request."

Next, you will review the pull request again and click "Merge pull request" to finalize the process. Verify the branches have merged under "Insights" --> "Network" or by navigating to the `main` branch and check if the expected new files are there.

We can now delete the merged branch, GitHub will usually automatically show a pop-up saying the pull request was successful and has been closed. There will be an option here to delete the branch. 
Alternatively, navigate to the branch view by clicking the "Branches" tab at the top of the main page, then click the trash bin icon next to the old branch.
