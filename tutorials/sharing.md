# Turning a project into a GitHub repository and sharing it

Turn any project, whether finished or unfinished, into a Git repository. This is useful to be able to easily share, reuse, collaborate, or even just to have a backup.

### Create a new repository

Create a new file directory on your computer and add some files. It doesn't really matter what you put in there, since this is just practice for creating a new repository from local files. 

In the upper right of the GitHub, regardless of what page you're on, there will be a "+" symbol in the top right near your profile icon. 
Click "+" --> "New repository."

Then, you will need to name your new repository, add a short description, and select whether it is public or private. Additionally, make sure the option "Add a README file" under the "Initialize this repository with:" header is checked. You can then click "Create repository."

### Upload files
In the main branch of the repository, click the "+" button next to the green "Code" button and select "Upload files." You can then drag and drop the file directory you created.

You have now pushed a local repository to a remote repository hosted on GitHub!
