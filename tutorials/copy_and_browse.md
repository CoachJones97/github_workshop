# Copy & browse an existing project repository

For this tutorial, we will make a copy of this repository and browse the `example` folder.

### Creating a copy of the repository by forking

A **repository** is a collection of files in a directory and is owned by a user or organization. To make a copy of a repository, first we want to navigate to the `main` branch.

[https://github.com/Maughan-Lab/github_workshop](https://github.com/Maughan-Lab/github_workshop)

Then, click the "Fork" button at the top right of the page. You should automatically be redirected to your copy of the repository **USER/github_workshop**.

### Browsing an existing project

1) Basic browsing: From the repository view, we can view the commit history at the top right (underneath the big green "Code" button). Here we can see every change made to the repository, who has committed, and the unique identifier associated with each commit.
2) Single file history: Navigate to the file view, Main page --> `example` directory --> `chauvenet.txt`. Click the "History" button near the top right to view the change history to this specific file.
3) Searching: Version control makes it easy to find instances of a certain term, useful for things like finding variable or function definitions. On the main page, use the search bar at the top to find all the buildings listed with an Illinois Street address by searching "Illinois".
4) Find who last modified a file: Navigate to any `.txt` file in the `example` directory. At the top of the code block, there are three options: Preview, Code, and Blame. Select "Blame" to see the last user to modify the file and when that change occured.
